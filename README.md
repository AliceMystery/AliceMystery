- 👋 Hi, I’m @AliceMystery
- 👀 I’m interested in ...Python. I am autistic and am teaching myself. I work at Mind Shift as a data analyst. But there are so many fun things to do with Python I have to learn it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... various subjects related to Python. I am finally knuckling down and learning everything I need like VS code, GIT, Stack Overflow, Windows Command Prompt, and Python mostly from sentdex and his discord channel.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing yet as I am only a beginner.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
